				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Pakistan ISI chief Lieutenant General Faiz Hameed said ‘everything will be okay’ as he landed in Kabul on Saturday for a discussion on the new government in Afghanistan. The Taliban, on the other hand, postponed the announcement of their government formation.

						<li>
							Pakistan media reported that the ISI chief was invited by the Taliban leadership to discuss the soon-to-be-formed government.
